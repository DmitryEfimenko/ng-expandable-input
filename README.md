# Expandable Input

A component consisting of a trigger element (button/icon/anything else...) and an input which shows by sliding to the left when the button is clicked.
Both, the trigger element and the input need to be supplied allowing a lot of flexibility.

This repository consists of three main packages:
* [@ng-expandable-input/cdk](https://github.com/DmitryEfimenko/ng-expandable-input/tree/master/projects/ng-expandable-input)
* [@ng-expandable-input/material](https://github.com/DmitryEfimenko/ng-expandable-input/tree/master/projects/ng-expandable-input-material)
* [@ng-expandable-input/bootstrap](https://github.com/DmitryEfimenko/ng-expandable-input/tree/master/projects/ng-expandable-input-bootstrap)

The CDK package is a package that material and bootstrap packages build on top of. In contrast to the two latter packages the CDK package does not assume any application styling.
